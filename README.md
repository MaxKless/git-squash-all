# git-squash-all README

Cleaning up a branch after developing a large feature?

Don't want your coworkers to see your sloppy commit messages?

Squashing your commits is a great feature but manually replacing every "pick" statement can be tedious.

Introducing: **git-squash-all**

Instantly select _squash_ for every commit in your `git-rebase-todo` (except the first)!

## Features

Run `Git Squash All` while doing an interactive rebase and automatically squash all commits. That's it.

> :rocket: works with GitLens!!

## Working with Markdown

**Note:** You can author your README using Visual Studio Code. Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

- Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux)
- Toggle preview (`Shift+CMD+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux)
- Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Space` (macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets
